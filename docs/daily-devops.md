<h2><strong>Laugh of the Day</strong></h2>

<blockquote><h3>My neighbor is a 90 year old with Alzheimer's, I see him every morning and he asks me If I've seen his wife.
Every day I have to tell this poor man that his wife died 20 years ago.
I could have moved to another house or even ignore his question.</h3><h4><i>But the look of joy in his eyes whenever I answer him is worth the world.</i></h4></blockquote>
