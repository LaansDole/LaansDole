## Usage

***CSS files with underscore `_` are the compiled result from the `extra_sass` directory, which contains Bootstrap style.***
- For example, from the `root` of the repository:
```bash
chmod +x ./sassy.sh
source ./sassy.sh
```
- Add the compiled file to [mkdocs.yml/extra_css/bootstrap/](./bootstrap/)
